### Simple Linear Regression:
The simple linear regression equation is typically represented as:

$y = mx + b$

Where:
- $y$ is the dependent variable.
- $x$ is the independent variable.
- $m$ is the slope of the regression line.
- $b$ is the y-intercept.

### Multiple Linear Regression:
For multiple linear regression with 'n' independent variables $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$:

$y = b_0 + b_1 \cdot x_1 + b_2 \cdot x_2 + ... + b_n \cdot x_n$

Where:
- $y$ is the dependent variable.
- $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ are the independent variables.
- $b_0$ is the y-intercept.
- $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$ are the coefficients associated with each independent variable.

Feel free to customize these templates based on your specific regression models and variable names. Simply replace the placeholders with your actual variable names and coefficients.
